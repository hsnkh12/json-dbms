        - collection 2 



json-dbms start -p 3333 -d /myapp/data 


When first running this command, the program will look for config.json file in given dir.
If not found, it will create a new config.js (non-editable) file in this dir, by asking the user for some information like, username, password (pasword will be hashed), and first project name. 
Else, the program will run fine and will be waiting for executing queries.
queries execution could be done in 2 ways.
1- using a client library that will be created in nodeJS
2- directly from the cli 
3- using telnet by establishing tcp communication


for each query sent, there will be headers added to the query using a custom protocol. headers will contain some
information like, project_name, username, password. 
something like
''' 
/project_name:''/username:''/password:''/query:''
'''
